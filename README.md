# Katalium Framework - TestNG and Selenium made easy

Katalium is a test automation framework based on TestNG and Selenium that provides a blueprint for test automation projects.

For software testers and automation engineers who want to write Selenium tests, Katalon Studio is the best option at this moment, with a lot of built-in features to make designing test cases and applying CI/CD effortlessly. However, for those who still needs to work with TestNG and Selenium, Katalium Framework will give you a head start.

The framework is designed to be lightweight. Standard functions of TestNG, Selenium, and other popular open-source frameworks are leveraged to minimize the learning curve and transition efforts.
